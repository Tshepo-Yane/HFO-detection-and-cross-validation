# HFO-detection-and-cross-validation
We will explore a dataset of candidate HFOs detected using the algorithm of Staba et al. The raw recordings from which this dataset arises come from a human subject with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and were contributed by the laboratory of Dr. Greg Worrell at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.
